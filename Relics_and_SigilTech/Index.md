### Notes
- **Ethical vs Unethical Divide**: Most relics originate as research prototypes within the **Aetherion Society**, but are co-opted and weaponized by the **Order of the Black Cross**.  
- **Resistance Stance**: The Resistance treats these tools as corruptions of the Logos path, preferring attunement via **Soulcipher Relics**.
