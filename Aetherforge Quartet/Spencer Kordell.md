# Spencer Kordell

![[Media/Characters/Spencer_Kordell_Portrait.png|300]]

## Overview
Spencer Kordell treats Saint Radian Academy like a crime scene. Every rumor is evidence, every social trend a pattern with deeper meaning. He is the “Student Detective,” obsessively cataloguing the hidden structures of narrative control at the school. His meticulous investigative nature keeps him isolated, but also makes him a crucial chronicler of the Cabal’s influence.

## Abilities
- Extreme observational skills and pattern recognition.
- Maintains extensive case files and a blog called *“The Pattern.”*
- Connects social phenomena like the [[Shipping Wars]] to Cabal strategies.
- Strong intuition paired with data—often paranoid, but often right.

## Personality
- Melancholic, world-weary beyond his years.  
- Driven by **tragic empathy**: desperately wants to protect students trapped in unseen manipulations.  
- Obsessive about details; sees truths no one else notices.

## Role in the Cognitive Dissonance Arc
- Observes and documents [[Professor Nyx Helverd]]’s lectures and their disruption.  
- Maps out the escalation of the [[Shipping Wars]].  
- Notes DeMarco as “Subject Zero” — a perfectly programmed Cabal product.  
- One of the few to suspect [[Crystalis]] is playing a double game with her “Illustra” persona.  

## Narrative Position
- Serves as the *evidence keeper.* Where Alexander intuits truth, Spencer *proves it*.  
- His great dilemma: remain a detached observer, or risk everything to act?
