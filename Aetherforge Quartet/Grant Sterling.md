# Grant Sterling
![[Media/Characters/Grant_Sterling_Portrait.png|300]]

## Overview
Grant Sterling is the “Pragmatic Leader” archetype—the hands-on problem solver at Saint Radian. Where others manipulate narratives, Grant builds systems. He is confident, approachable, and heroic without ego. He enables others by constructing the tools they need to resist Cabal control.  

## Distinct Visuals
- Broad-shouldered, dependable build.  
- Short curly light brown hair, rectangular glasses.  
- Rolled-up gray shirt, loosened red tie.  
- Trademark quirk: **two watches** — a digital smartwatch and a classic analog, symbolizing his balance between digital systems and real-world grounding.

## Abilities
- Inventor, builder, systems engineer.  
- Can rig networks, jailbreak F-Link code, and design counter-systems.  
- Calm and confident under pressure — “I’ll figure it out” energy.  

## Personality
- Reliable, statured, optimistic, and supportive.  
- Earned confidence: not arrogant, but capable.  
- Anchors others with his presence — a natural ally leader without seeking attention.  

## Role in the Cognitive Dissonance Arc
- Provides technical support to [[Professor Nyx Helverd]] by analyzing F-Link systems.  
- Potentially privy to Spencer’s underground blog *The Pattern* and uses data to strengthen his projects.  
- Serves as foil to [[DeMarco Zavarus]] — where DeMarco builds aesthetic systems of control, Grant builds functional systems of freedom.  

## Narrative Position
Grant represents the **builder archetype** in the war of narratives. While others argue and perceive, Grant *constructs the practical infrastructure* needed for resistance.
