# The Aetherion Society

The **Aetherion Society** represents the “engineers” of Saint Radian. Its students are coders, builders, and techno-mystics who design containment systems for beasts and proto-resistance tech.  

**Fraternity — Titan’s Workshop**: an industrial dormitory filled with personal labs, machine scrap, and myth-tech forges.  

- **Occult Specialty:** The **Aetherforge Protocol** — fusion of quantum coding, relic-forging, and machine learning. They believe beasts are networks of symbolic data to be stabilized.  
- **Secret:** Their research is *unwittingly siphoned into F-Link* by the Order, strengthening the enemy’s control nets.  
- **Rivalry:** Endless clashes with **Obsidian Glyphs**, who argue that symbols, not code, are the truest tether.  
- **Uniform Accents:** Blazer seams subtly traced with glowing circuit-like etchings.
