# The Astral Chorus

The **Astral Chorus** blends psychology, psychic empathy, and occult archetype studies into a school of astral science. They pioneer experiments into shared dreamwalking and archetypal resonance.  

**Dormitory — The Lyceum**: circular chambers painted with murals of constellations and archetypal figures, doubling as meditation and dream-mapping spaces.  

- **Occult Specialty:** *Empathic attunement* — members can bond willingly with beasts rather than bind them. This skill alone gives them disproportionate power.  
- **Role in Academy:** Their empathetic research “softens” students, making them harder to indoctrinate. This puts them in Finch’s crosshairs.  
- **Rivalry:** At odds with **Crimson Flame**, debating compassion vs domination as the true path to strength.  
- **Uniform Accents:** Constellation-embroidered linings in ties, faint dream-halo around their crest when using gifts.
