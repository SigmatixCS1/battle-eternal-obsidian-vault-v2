# Order of the Eternal Sol

The **Order of the Eternal Sol** is the most prestigious and publicly celebrated society at Saint Radian Academy. Its members are groomed to be the charismatic leaders, eloquent speakers, and shining paragons of the Order of the Black Cross's new world. They operate under a philosophy of "narrative radiance," believing that truth is not found but *created* through unwavering confidence and the projection of an unassailable, glorious vision.

**Dormitory â€” The Empyrean Spire**: A gleaming tower with sunstone architecture and light-well atriums that are always bathed in a warm, golden glow, even at night. It is designed to inspire awe and a sense of divine presence.

- **Occult Specialty:** Members are trained in **Photokinesis**, the manipulation of light for both illusory displays of grandeur and potent offensive beams. Their core skill, however, is **Aura Projection**, allowing them to radiate feelings of authority, trust, and inspiration, making them natural influencers within the student body.
- **Role in the Academy:** They are the willing agents of the Division Engine's public-facing campaigns. They lead student government, champion school-sanctioned events, and are the first to denounce those who question the academy's doctrines. They see themselves as righteous crusaders, unaware they are polishing the cage for everyone else.
- **Rivalry:** They hold deep contempt for the **House of the Liminal Veil**, viewing their reliance on shadow and deceit as cowardly. They also clash with the **Order of the Obsidian Glyphs**, dismissing their obsession with ancient, complex truths as morbid and irrelevant in a world that needs bold, simple light.
- **Uniform Accents:** The standard SR crest is woven with brilliant gold thread that catches the light. Their ties and blazer linings often feature subtle sunburst patterns. When using their powers, a faint, golden corona can be seen around them.
