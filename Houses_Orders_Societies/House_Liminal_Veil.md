# The House of the Liminal Veil

The **Liminal Veil** is the academy’s secret-police order. Students here specialize in surveillance, disguise, and illusionary craft. They are often proxies of the Furies, embedding false narratives among peers.  

**Dormitory — Nadir Hall**: corridors of shifting glass and shadow, designed to disorient newcomers.  

- **Occult Specialty:** Shapeshifting bonds with narrative agents like kitsune, study of forget-me-not hexes and false memory layers.  
- **Role in Academy:** They are the Order’s spies, ensuring student resistance never gains too much ground.  
- **Rivalry:** Effectively with everyone.  
- **Uniform Accents:** Crest flickering in shadow, ties shifting subtly in shade when channeling power.
