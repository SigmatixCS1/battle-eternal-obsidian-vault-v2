# Order of the Obsidian Glyphs

The **Order of the Obsidian Glyphs** is the oldest intellectual society at Saint Radian. Students here believe that every truth is written before it is spoken, every outcome etched in hidden inscriptions. They pore over scripts, ancient alphabets, runic sequences, and living word-magic.  

**Dormitory — The Sepulchre**: shadowy stone halls covered with etched walls glowing faintly at night.  

- **Occult Specialty:** Binding scripts and *inscriptions* that either control beasts (*Dark Glyphs*) or harmonize with them (*Light Glyphs*).  
- **Role in the Academy:** Their “translations” are secretly harvested by the Division Engine, converting their knowledge into reality-manipulating memes.  
- **Rivalry:** They are in constant conflict with the technocratic **Aetherion Society** for control over beast-capture methodologies (glyphic vs digital).  
- **Uniform Accents:** Silver-stitched SR crests, cuff runes faintly glowing when students focus.
