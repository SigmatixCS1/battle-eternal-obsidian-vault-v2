# House of Living Sigils

The **House of Living Sigils** is the most introverted of the Saint Radian Orders. They graft glyphs into natural mediums — roots, vines, fungi — creating **bio-sigils** that flourish into living wards or curses.  

**Dormitory — The Verdant Spire**: a vertical greenhouse-tower, climbing with vines where rooms “pulse” like resonant plant cells.  

- **Occult Specialty:** Creation of living glyph-blooms which can channel beast energy. Herbal “sigil grafts” are used for both healing and hexcraft.  
- **Role in Academy:** Often appears neutral, but they are crucial suppliers of reagents for Relic forging.  
- **Uniform Accents:** Blazer trim embroidered with synchronous green sigils, sometimes sprouting faint floral shimmer.
