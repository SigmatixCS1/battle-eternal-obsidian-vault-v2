# The Order of the Crimson Flame

The **Order of the Crimson Flame** is Saint Radian’s martial society. Competitive, proud, and volatile, they embrace combat as purification. Their members forge strength through constant dueling and ritual tournaments that are staged for harvestable emotional drama.  

**Dormitory — The Crucible**: a cavernous hall resembling an old foundry, its firepits burning as both forge and battleground.  

- **Occult Specialty:** Temporary *essence channeling* — members allow spectral fragments of beasts (griffons, manticores) to overlay their bodies during ritual combat.  
- **Role in Academy:** The flame-fights are some of the biggest proxies for the Order’s emotional harvesting, stoking passion and rage.  
- **Rivalry:** They despise the **Astral Chorus** for preferring intellect/empathy over strength.  
- **Uniform Accents:** Flame-sealed crests, sometimes glowing around the SR logo in combat.
