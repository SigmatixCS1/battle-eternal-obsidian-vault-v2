## **Order of the Black Sun – Architects of Enslavement**

The **Order of the Black Sun** is the shadow network orchestrating this war. Elite technocrats, corporate executives, and occult priest‑operators form a **secret alliance** who seek total control over consciousness.

- **[[The Dark Hold]]:** A monstrous “Server Zero” — a flesh‑bound codex infused with blockchain‑like smart contracts that govern the fabric of reality. Feeding it emotions allows new “code” to be written into existence.
- **[[The Crimson Convergence]]:** The Cabal’s ultimate ritual — merging the Dark Hold with Earth’s ley lines during a convergence of harvested emotions, permanently enslaving consciousness.
