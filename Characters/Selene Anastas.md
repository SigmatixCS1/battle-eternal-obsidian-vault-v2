# Selene Anastas

![[Media/Characters/Selene_Anastas_Portrait.png|300]]

### Overview

Selene Anastas is a gifted but withdrawn student of the **Astral Chorus**, known for her distant gaze and the strangely patterned fabrics of her uniform, which seem to shift with dreamlike imagery. She is a powerful **Oneiromancer**, possessing a natural ability to enter the "Dreamfield"â€”the psychic network of the collective unconscious. Her sketches and quiet observations are not random doodles but fragmented prophecies, making her one of Saint Radian's most valuable and vulnerable assets.

### Gift: Oneiromancy (Dream-Walking)

Through a deep **Resonance with Morpheus**, the god of dreams, Selene can navigate the dreams of others and the archetypal currents that flow beneath the academy. She can interpret symbolic visions, witness events from a psychic distance, and sometimes even pull small, paradoxical "dream tokens" into the waking world. This gift makes her a living repository of secrets, but it also leaves her psychically exposed and often disconnected from reality.

### Backstory

Selene was scouted by Saint Radian after an incident at her former art academy where she painted a detailed portrait of a catastrophic fire a week before it happened. Seen as a liability there, the Order of the Black Cross recognized her potential as a predictive tool. She is under constant, subtle surveillance, with the faculty trying to interpret her visions to foresee and neutralize resistance efforts.

### Relationships & Rivalries

*   **House:** [[Astral Chorus]]. She is the heart of this society, embodying their deepest principles.
*   **Allies:**
    *   **[[Elara Vance]]:** As a fellow empath in the Astral Chorus, Elara is one of the few who understands the burden of Selene's gift and often acts as her anchor to the real world.
    *   **[[Spencer Kordell]]:** She may anonymously provide him with cryptic sketches or warnings. His analytical mind is perfectly suited to deciphering her symbolic visions, creating a powerful intelligence-gathering duo.
*   **Rivals / Threats:**
    *   **[[The Dialectic Order]]:** Members of this society often challenge her, dismissing her "unprovable" visions as emotional nonsense.
    *   **[[House of the Liminal Veil]]:** They see her as the ultimate espionage asset and may attempt to manipulate or control her access to the Dreamfield for their own ends.
