# Castor "Cas" Nightfall

![[Media/Characters/Castor_Nightfall_Portrait.png|300]]

### Overview

Castor "Cas" Nightfall is the most enigmatic member of the Quartet, a quiet and detached student who is unknowingly a dormant vessel for the divine **Mantle of Nemesis & Ares**. Hailing from a long line of sorcerers, he is a skilled practitioner of ancestral magic, but the true, terrifying scope of his destiny remains a mystery to him. He moves through the halls of Saint Radian like a ghost, his unnerving stillness and profound silence causing ripples of unease among those sensitive enough to feel the immense, sleeping power within him. He is not yet a judge; he is the silence before the verdict.

### Divine Mantle & Powers (Latent)

During the Cognitive Dissonance Arc, Castor's divine power is **unawakened and latent**. He operates primarily with the skills he inherited.

-   **Ancestral Sorcery:** Can summon spirits and manipulate minor threads of fate. His magic often manifests as acts of subtle, karmic rebalancing.
-   **Crystal Ball Scrying:** He uses his crystal ball not for grand judgments, but for personal clarity, observing the intricate patterns of cause and effect at the academy from a safe, analytical distance.

### Role in the Cognitive Dissonance Arc

Castor is a passive but profoundly disruptive force during this arc. He is a walking mystery, a "glitch" in the social and psychic fabric of the academy.

-   **The Unknowing Terror:** In [[Professor Nyx Helverd]]’s class, Castor is a source of inexplicable dread for the professor. Nyx, sensitive to archetypal energies, feels the suffocating weight of a final, absolute judgment radiating from him but sees only a quiet student. This disconnect is a source of intense psychological distress for Nyx.
-   **The Oracle's Blind Spot:** When [[Alexander Holmes Harukaza]] attempts a casual tarot reading on him for fun, the act triggers a catastrophic magical failure. The cards violently self-destruct—exploding, evaporating, and disintegrating—leaving only a single, blank black card with a silver sickle emblem scorched into its surface. This event deeply unnerves Alexander, marking Castor as someone who exists outside the predictable flow of fate.
-   **The Silent Observer of the "Shipping Wars":** He watches the manufactured social drama with an almost alien detachment, documenting the patterns of behavior in a private journal as if studying an entirely foreign species. He is not yet passing judgment, merely collecting the data for a trial he doesn't know he is destined to preside over.
-   **The F-Link Anomaly:** He is one of the few students F-Link has trouble profiling. His lack of overt emotional reactions provides almost no data to harvest, making him an anomaly in the Order's system. He neither accepts nor rejects F-Link; he simply ignores it, which the system interprets as a critical error.

### Perceptions from Other Characters

Castor's latent power creates a variety of reactions from those around him, especially the psychically sensitive.

*   **[[Elara Vance]]:** As a deep empath, Elara finds Castor profoundly unsettling. When she tries to read him, she feels nothing—a perfect, silent void where a person's emotions should be. This "psychic silence" is more terrifying to her than overt anger or malice. She feels an instinctual need to keep her distance, as if standing too close to a black hole.
*   **[[Selene Anastas]]:** In her dreams, Castor appears not as a person but as a recurring, abstract symbol: a set of perfectly balanced scales or a cracked and crumbling throne. She can't see his face in the Dreamfield, only the immense, gravitational weight of the archetype he carries. She knows he is central to the coming "Fracture" she foresees, but his role is a terrifying blank in her visions.
*   **[[Kaelen Thorne]]:** As a trained warrior who reads intent and body language, Kael sees Castor as the ultimate wild card. He recognizes Castor's coiled stillness not as passivity, but as the perfect economy of motion of a predator. He can't get a read on Castor's loyalties or intentions, which makes Castor the one person on campus Kael is genuinely wary of confronting.
*   **[[DeMarco Zavarus]]:** DeMarco dismisses Castor as an irrelevant, gloomy loner. However, on a subconscious level, his own guilt over the Quantum Fracture makes him deeply uncomfortable with Castor's silent, watchful presence. He finds himself unconsciously avoiding Castor in the hallways, driven by an instinct he can't logically explain.
