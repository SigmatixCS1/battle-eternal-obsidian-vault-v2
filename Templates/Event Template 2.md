# Narrative Description (Story Notes)

**Opening:**  
(Set the scene — environment, initial tone, who is present, what the Academy or Cabal is “selling” it as.)

**Scene / Conflict Beats:**  
- Describe the main action, escalation, or mystery.
- Identify who struggles and how their archetypal powers start leaking into play.

**Climax:**  
(The peak turning point — victory / loss / psychic fracture / revelation.)

**Aftermath:**  
- How does campus react?  
- Faculty vs. Student interpretations.  
- How does Cabal reframing attempt to control the narrative?  
- Any foreshadowing symbols, myth-beast sightings, or divine messengers?

# Reactions

- **Faculty:** How teachers minimize, deny, or coerce. Which resistance members quietly mark the anomaly.  
- **Supporting Cast:** Spencer records evidence? Grant builds response tech? Quentin intervenes?
