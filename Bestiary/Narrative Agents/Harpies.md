# Harpies

## üåÄ Battle Eternal Lore
Harpies are the archetypes of divine retribution and contamination, the personification of a punishment that is both swift and defiling. They are drawn to places where power is abused and rules are broken with impunity, making the rigidly structured and hypocritical environment of Saint Radian Academy a perfect hunting ground. They are not agents of the Order, nor are they allies of the Resistance. They are a force of chaotic justice, attracted to the "scent" of corruption, broken oaths, and the psychic filth generated by the Concordance's manipulation. They manifest to enact a brutal and public punishment that serves as a warning to all.

## üé≠ Narrative Role
- **Agents of Karmic Punishment:** At Saint Radian, the Harpies do not take on long-term human guises. They manifest suddenly, like a storm, often appearing as a trio of terrifying, bird-like women to drag away or publicly torment a specific target. Their victims are typically prefects who have become excessively cruel, faculty members engaged in forbidden occult rituals, or students who have betrayed a profound trust for personal gain.
- **Plot Complication & Moral Ambiguity:** A Harpy attack is a chaotic event. While they may target a genuine villain, their methods are horrifying and can disrupt the plans of both the Concordance and the Resistance. The Quartet might find themselves in the difficult position of having to stop a Harpy attack to save a "bad" person, creating intense moral conflict.
- **Visible Manifestations of a "Sick" System:** The more corrupt and oppressive the school becomes, the more frequently the Harpies appear. They are a barometer for the spiritual sickness of the institution itself, a visible symptom of the rot beneath the pristine surface.

## üé® Visual Prompts
- "Three grotesque women with massive, dirty raptor wings and talons, their faces contorted in furious shrieks, descending into a pristine school courtyard under a stormy grey sky. Students below are scattering in terror."
- "A terrified student prefect, cornered in a gothic archway, his face pale as the shadow of massive wings falls over him, talons reaching into the frame. The air is filled with swirling feathers and debris."
