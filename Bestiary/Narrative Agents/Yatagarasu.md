# Yatagarasu

## � Battle Eternal Lore
A celestial, three-legged crow from the realm of the sun, the Yatagarasu is a divine messenger and guide. It has taken on a human form to operate within Saint Radian Academy, drawn by the awakening of the Logos within the Quartet. The Yatagarasu views the Order of the Black Cross's attempts to suppress free will as a violation of the sacred balance, and it has chosen to intervene subtly, using its immense wisdom and insight to nudge the Quartet toward their destined roles.

## � Narrative Role
- **The Mysterious Mentor:** The Yatagarasu has adopted the guise of **"Professor Eclipse,"** a soft-spoken, enigmatic teacher of Comparative Mythology and Ancient Symbolism. Eclipse's classes are always optional, but those who attend find themselves presented with parables and koans that directly address their inner struggles and hidden potential.
- **Divine Intervention:** When a member of the Quartet is at a critical juncture, lost, or facing a moral dilemma, the Yatagarasu will manifest in some form—often as a cryptic message scrawled on a chalkboard, a timely book recommendation, or a fleeting vision of a three-legged crow in a moment of introspection.
- **Balance and Alignment:** Unlike the Kitsune, who delights in chaos, the Yatagarasu seeks to restore balance. It will not directly fight the Order, but it will ensure that the Quartet remains aligned with their true purpose, preventing them from being swayed by either the Concordance's propaganda or their own darker impulses.

## � Visual Prompts
- "A serene, bespectacled professor with an androgynous appearance, standing before a chalkboard filled with ancient symbols and celestial diagrams, a faint glow of sunlight around them, anime realism, muted colors."
- "A shadow on the wall takes the form of a three-legged crow, its eyes glowing like miniature suns, as a student sits alone in contemplation, dramatic lighting, symbolic."
