# Kitsune

## 🌀 Battle Eternal Lore
An ancient and intelligent archetypal spirit, the Kitsune is a master of illusion, strategy, and social dynamics. They are drawn to the 4D bleed not out of malice or duty, but because Saint Radian Academy has become the most intricate and high-stakes "game" on the planet. They despise the sterile, forced conformity of the Order of the Black Cross, viewing F-Link as an insult to true intelligence and free will. Adopting a flawless human guise, a Kitsune has enrolled at the academy as a transfer student, eager to test the players, disrupt the game board, and see if the humans' inner Logos is truly as powerful as the legends say.

## 🎭 Narrative Role
- **Infiltrator and Catalyst:** Appears at Saint Radian as "Ren," an impossibly charismatic, sharp-witted, and androgynously beautiful transfer student. Ren's academic records are perfect but unverifiable, and they immediately become a figure of fascination and suspicion.
- **The Ultimate Wild Card:** Ren will act as a chaotic third party. They might provide Alexander with a crucial piece of encrypted data one day, only to publicly humiliate Crystalis with a well-aimed psychological truth the next. Their goal is not to help the Resistance win, but to force the Quartet to become smarter, stronger, and more cunning players.
- **A Mirror for the Quartet:** The Kitsune will challenge each member's core beliefs, exposing their flaws and forcing them to grow beyond simplistic notions of good and evil. They are a living lesson that in a war of narratives, truth can be a weapon, a shield, or a trap, all depending on how it's wielded.

## 🎨 Visual Prompts
- "An enigmatic androgynous Japanese student with a fox-like smirk, leaning against a gothic school corridor wall, their eyes glinting with ancient intelligence, anime realism, sharp shadows."
- "In a security camera's glitched feed, the image of a student flickers for a split second, revealing nine spectral fox tails fanning out behind them like a ghostly aura."

## 🃏 Card Integration
- **Archetypal (5-10%)**: **Shapeshift** - When this card is played, you may swap one card in your hand with a random card from your opponent's hand. Represents the Kitsune's ability to disrupt plans and turn an enemy's strength against them.
