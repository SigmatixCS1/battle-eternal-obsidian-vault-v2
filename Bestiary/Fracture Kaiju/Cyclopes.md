# Cyclopes

## üåÄ Battle Eternal Lore
The Cyclopes of the Fracture are not ancient smiths, but horrifying archetypes of weaponized single-mindedness. Born from the 4D bleed, they are the physical manifestation of a mind in the agony of cognitive dissonance‚Äîa soul being violently forced by F-Link and Concordance dogma to abandon multifaceted truth for a single, unchangeable perspective. Their one massive eye is not an organ of sight, but a psychic projector, sometimes flashing with propaganda glyphs or the screaming silhouette of the trapped consciousness within. They are drawn to environments of intense mental conflict, like the indoctrination halls and debate chambers of Saint Radian Academy, and their immense strength is fueled by the rage of a collapsing worldview.

## üé≠ Narrative Role
- **Central to the Cognitive Dissonance Arc:** Cyclopes manifest directly on the Saint Radian campus when students are pushed to a mental breaking point. They are the psychic "fever" of the student body, a monster born from the friction between the Order's lies and a student's lingering Logos.
- They represent the end state of F-Link's indoctrination: a being with immense power but no peripheral vision, incapable of seeing any truth but the one projected into its mind.
- To defeat a Cyclops, the Quartet must do more than fight it physically; they must attack the flawed premise it represents, using their own Familiars (Truth, Strategy, etc.) to expose the lie and momentarily break its dogmatic focus, causing it to destabilize.

## üé® Visual Prompts
- "A hulking giant made of cracked concrete and glitching data, its single eye a television screen projecting hypnotic corporate logos, rampaging through a school library, its roar a distorted audio file."
- "Close-up on a cyclops's eye, revealing a screaming human silhouette trapped behind the lens of a camera, surrounded by static and glyphs, digital horror, surreal."

## üÉè Card Integration
- **Rare (15-20%)**: **Tunnel Vision** - When this card is played, your opponent must choose one card type (e.g., character, event). They cannot play any other card types during their next turn.
