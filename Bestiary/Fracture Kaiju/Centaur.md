# Centaur

## 🌀 Battle Eternal Lore
Not the wise teachers of myth, the Centaurs of the Fracture are fragmented archetypes of the conflict between instinct and reason, torn violently into the 3D world. Their human torsos often appear contorted in confusion or rage, while their equine bodies move with a jarring, unnatural gait, sometimes glitching like a corrupted file. They are drawn to places of strong emotional resonance—sports fields, debate halls, lonely corridors—and lash out at the structured reality they cannot comprehend. They are territorial, aggressive, and driven by a primal fear born from their displacement.

## 🎭 Narrative Role
- To serve as a tangible, physical threat that makes the invisible war visible. They are the frontline monsters that force the Quartet to react.
- Their appearance can disrupt Cabal operations or Resistance plans equally, acting as chaotic third parties.
- Encounters with them are less about narrative combat and more about survival, testing the Quartet's ability to think on their feet and combine their powers against a brute-force threat.

## 🎨 Visual Prompts
- "A herd of centaurs made of cracked stone and raw earth, charging through a manicured school courtyard at night, their eyes glowing with confused rage, motion blur, dynamic action shot."
- "Glitching centaur, its form shifting between a classic mythological beast and corrupted digital static, caught in the headlights of a campus security vehicle, cyberpunk horror aesthetic."

## 🃏 Card Integration
- **Rare (15-20%)**: **Charge** - When this card is played, it deals direct damage to an opponent's narrative integrity (health), bypassing any defenders for that turn.
