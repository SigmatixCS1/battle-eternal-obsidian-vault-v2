# Typhon & Echidna

## üåÄ Battle Eternal Lore
If the Gorgon is a prison and Valac is a secret, Typhon and Echidna are the abyss itself. They are not merely entities existing *within* the 4D realm; they are its primordial, chaotic substrate. Typhon, the "Father of All Monsters," is the archetype of raw, destructive, unmaking force. Echidna, the "Mother of All Monsters," is the archetype of horrifying, endless, cancerous creation. They are the twin forces of chaos that existed before any story was ever told.

The Order of the Black Cross did not capture them. The Order's entire, meticulously crafted reality is a fragile skin stretched taut over their slumbering forms. The Dark Hold, F-Link, the Division Engine‚Äîall of it is an elaborate system designed to impose a single, stable narrative on the universe, essentially acting as a cage of pure logic to keep this ultimate chaos dormant. They are the one threat the Order truly fears, as they cannot be controlled, weaponized, or even fully comprehended.

## üé≠ Narrative Role
- **The True Apocalypse:** Typhon and Echidna are the failure state of the Order's grand plan. The **Crimson Convergence** is an act of supreme hubris; by attempting to collapse all consciousness into a single point, [[Cassian Thorne]] risks shattering the very narrative fabric that keeps these beings asleep. Their awakening would not be a "bleed"‚Äîit would be a deluge, erasing the Order, the Resistance, and all of human reality, replacing it with an age of monsters.
- **A Force Beyond Good and Evil:** They cannot be fought in a conventional sense. They are a geological force of narrative reality. The final conflict of *Battle Eternal* may not be about defeating the Order, but about a desperate, last-ditch effort by all surviving factions (including remnants of the Order) to prevent them from waking up.
- **The Source of All Kaiju:** In a terrifying twist, it may be revealed that the **Fracture Kaiju** (Centaurs, Cyclopes) are not just displaced archetypes, but faint, half-formed "dream-children" of the stirring Echidna, leaking into reality through the cracks.

## üé® Visual Prompts
- **(Typhon):** "A colossal, apocalyptic storm giant whose form is barely humanoid, made of swirling hurricane clouds, volcanic magma, and pure chaotic energy. He dwarfs the Saint Radian Academy, his presence alone causing reality to warp and fray at the edges."
- **(Echidna):** "A horrifyingly vast, serpentine entity coiled in the depths of a cosmic abyss beneath the world. Her shimmering scales shift and writhe, revealing within them the nightmarish forms of every monster ever conceived. Her very presence is a promise of endless, terrifying birth."

## üÉè Card Integration
- **Divine (Unique)**: **Father's Wrath, Mother's Teeth** - When this card is played, remove all cards your opponent controls (on the field, in hand, and in their discard pile) from the game. For each card removed this way, you may search your deck for a "Kaiju" or "Threat" beast and put it directly into play.
