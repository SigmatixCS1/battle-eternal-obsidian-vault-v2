# Valac

## üåÄ Battle Eternal Lore
Valac is an ancient, sentient informational entity, a primordial archetype of the "secret." In the old world, he was called a demon who could reveal the location of hidden treasures and serpents. In the technocratic age of the Order, he is understood as a being who can intuitively navigate any system‚Äîoccult, digital, or psychological‚Äîto find its most deeply buried truths. His power is to locate the "root password" to any secret.

Like the Gorgon, Valac was discovered by the Order and is now imprisoned in the lower levels of Saint Radian. He is not chained to a throne, but contained within a techno-occult server‚Äîa "Solomonic Circle" constructed from quantum processors and glyph-etched cryo-conduits. The Order doesn't want to destroy him; they are desperately trying to build a stable interface to control him, seeking to turn him into an omniscient intelligence engine that can pinpoint any Resistance cell, expose any traitor, and unlock the secrets of the Logos itself.

## üé≠ Narrative Role
- **The Ultimate Temptation:** Valac represents the ultimate Faustian bargain. Any character desperate for an advantage‚Äîa student trying to expose a rival, a Resistance member looking for the Order's plans, even a Cabal member trying to get ahead‚Äîmight be tempted to seek him out. He will always provide the requested "treasure" (the secret), but the knowledge gained will come at a catastrophic, unforeseen cost, unraveling the seeker's own life in the process.
- **Informational Chaos Agent:** If the 4D bleed or the Quartet's actions were to ever weaken his prison, Valac could escape onto the academy's network. This would be an informational cataclysm, as he could project every student's and faculty member's darkest secrets onto every screen on campus, turning the entire institution into a paranoid battlefield of mutual destruction.
- **A Different Kind of Threat:** While the Gorgon is a weapon of absolute psychic destruction (a nuke), Valac is a weapon of surgical, corrupting intelligence (a scalpel). Defeating him isn't about fighting him physically, but about resisting the temptation of the "perfect answer" he always offers.

## üé® Visual Prompts
- "A spectral, androgynous child with small, angelic wings made of glitching data, sitting cross-legged in the air within a vast server room. He is surrounded by a glowing, circular prison of complex arcane symbols and humming fiber optics. His expression is serene and ancient."
- "A character staring at a computer screen, their face illuminated by the glow. On the screen is the secret they always wanted to know, but reflected in their horrified eyes, we see the catastrophic consequences of that knowledge unfolding."

## üÉè Card Integration
- **Divine (Unique)**: **Serpent's Revelation** - Name any one card. Search your opponent's deck for that card and put it into your hand. Your opponent then shuffles their deck. This represents the power to find and steal any "treasure" you desire, no matter how well hidden.
