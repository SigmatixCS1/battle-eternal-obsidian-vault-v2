# Griffon

## 🌀 Battle Eternal Lore
A majestic fusion of the king of beasts (lion) and the king of birds (eagle), the Griffon is the living archetype of righteous authority and strategic oversight. It is the manifestation of Crystalis's Logos, embodying her role as the "Strategic Queen." It rarely appears physically, instead manifesting as a sudden, piercing clarity of thought, a tactical overview of a chaotic situation, or the palpable aura of regal confidence that can halt an aggressor in their tracks. It is the guardian of the divine "treasure"—the unassailable logic and truth of the Logos.

## 🎭 Narrative Role
- Symbolizes Crystalis's tactical genius and her inherent, unshakeable authority in the face of the Cabal's manufactured control.
- Appears as a glint of light off a lens, the feeling of being watched from above, or the perfect, intuitive checkmate in a complex social or physical conflict.
- Foreshadows her destiny to unite and lead fractured Resistance cells.

## 🎨 Visual Prompts
- "Crystalline griffon aura, sharp geometric lines, forming behind a focused schoolgirl in uniform, a glowing chess board between them, anime realism, cool silver and sapphire tones."
- "Regal griffon with feathers of sharp silver light, perched atop a gothic clock tower, eyes glowing with tactical intelligence, hyper-detailed."

## 🃏 Card Integration
- **Legendary (2–5%)**: When this card is played, you may look at your opponent's hand. This represents the Griffon's gift of strategic omniscience and foresight.
