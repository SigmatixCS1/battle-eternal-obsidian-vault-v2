# Green Dragon

## 🌀 Battle Eternal Lore
The Green Dragon is the archetype of the earth's potential—the primordial bedrock of reality that can be shaped into perfect creation or shattered into chaotic ruin. It is the form of DeMarco's Logos, representing his immense talent for craftsmanship and the terrible weight of consequence for his one mistake: the Quantum Fracture. It doesn't roar; it resonates, manifesting as the hum in perfectly calibrated machinery, the flawless geometry in a crystal, or the cold, heavy feeling of the ground beneath his feet when he contemplates the damage he caused.

## 🎭 Narrative Role
- A constant, physical reminder of DeMarco's duality: his ability to create flawless systems and his capacity to break reality itself.
- It pushes him toward obsessive perfectionism as a way to control the chaotic power he wields.
- Foreshadows his critical role in either repairing the Quantum Fracture or using his understanding of it to weaponize the dimensional bleed against the Cabal.

## 🎨 Visual Prompts
- "A schoolboy with drafting tools, his shadow on the wall behind him is a massive jade dragon, its scales forming intricate geometric patterns, glowing with a subdued emerald light."
- "Intricate clockwork dragon coiling around a cracked orb of glass, green energy leaking from the fissures, reflecting in the eye of its creator, hyper-detailed, workshop aesthetic."
