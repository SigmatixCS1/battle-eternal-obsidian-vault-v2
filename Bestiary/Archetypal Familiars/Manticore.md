# Manticore

## 🌀 Battle Eternal Lore
The Manticore is the archetype of the predator that walks in plain sight, the living embodiment of the axiom that observation is not a passive act. It is the form of Castor's Logos, a composite beast representing his ability to synthesize disparate facts (the lion's body) through a quiet, human-like intelligence (the man's face) to deliver a single, paralyzing strike (the scorpion's tail). It manifests not as a creature, but as the prickling sensation on the back of the neck when a lie is told, the chilling silence that follows a revealed secret, or the feeling of being perfectly, inescapably understood. Its venom is not poison, but pure, unadulterated truth that dismantles a target's narrative reality.

## 🎭 Narrative Role
- Symbolizes Castor's unique and dangerous power: turning observation into a weapon that can neutralize a threat without a physical fight.
- Appears as a fleeting, impossible shadow, or is felt as the sudden weight of Castor's silent gaze just before he speaks a devastatingly simple truth.
- Foreshadows Castor's evolution from a passive observer to the Resistance's de facto inquisitor—the one who can identify spies and unravel conspiracies with a single, well-aimed piece of information.

## 🎨 Visual Prompts
- "A quiet schoolboy in a library, his shadow on the wall behind him is a monstrous manticore with a scorpion tail poised to strike, cinematic lighting, bookshelf-lined walls, a sense of quiet dread, anime realism."
- "A barbed scorpion stinger made of crystallized data and whispered text, dripping a single drop of glowing black ink, macro shot, abstract, digital art."

## 🃏 Card Integration
- **Legendary (2–5%)**: Look at your opponent's hand and force them to discard one card of your choice. This represents the Manticore's precise, lethal strike based on perfect observation.
