# Phoenix

## 🌀 Battle Eternal Lore
The Phoenix is the radiant embodiment of Alexander’s Helios‑source: rebirth, solar truth, and unstoppability. Appears as flickers of golden fire in mirrors, sudden waves of warmth, or wings blazing in moments of Logos resonance. It cannot be captured or destroyed, only reborn.
