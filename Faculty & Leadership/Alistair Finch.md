# Headmaster Alistair Finch

## Overview
Alistair Finch is the charismatic and deeply convicted Headmaster of the Saint Radian "Alpha" campus. A man in his 60s, he projects the image of a stern but loving patriarch, guiding his students toward a future of unity and purpose. He is a "True Believer" in the Order's mission, viewing his role as a sacred duty to save students from the painful burden of their own individuality. His eloquent speeches on conformity and the "Great Work" are both inspiring and deeply chilling.

### Methods of Control
- **Benevolent Tyranny:** Finch does not rule through fear alone, but through a carefully cultivated atmosphere of paternalistic control. He knows every student's psychological profile and masterfully manipulates their desires for acceptance, purpose, and approval.
- **Ideological Enforcement:** He personally oversees the curriculum designed to break down a student's sense of self. To him, the awakening of the [[Logos]] is not a miracle, but a **"cognitive virus"** that threatens the health of the collective and must be compassionately but firmly eradicated.

### Narrative Role
- **The On-Site Antagonist:** Headmaster Finch is the face and voice of the Order for the Quartet and the other students. He is the primary obstacle within the academy, the enforcer of the rules, and the deliverer of the Concordance's doctrine.
- **The Gatekeeper:** He represents the first major "boss" in the hierarchy. To strike a blow against the Order's plans at Saint Radian, the heroes must first find a way to overcome, deceive, or defy Headmaster Finch and his absolute control over the campus.
