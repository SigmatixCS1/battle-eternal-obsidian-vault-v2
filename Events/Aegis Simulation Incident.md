# Narrative Description (Story Notes)

**Opening:**  
The academy’s proudest VR chamber, *Aegis Simulation Hall*, is filled with students and faculty ready to witness precision combat.

**Key Scenes:**  
1. DeMarco engineers an “inevitable” victory with flawless glyph-coded tactics.  
2. Alexander, improvising unpredictably, slips through the cracks of the simulation.  
3. Castor silently observes, unnerving faculty with a cold aura.  

**Climax:**  
Alexander disrupts the simulation’s “script,” defeating DeMarco in front of peers. The chamber glitches with stray esoteric code — a foreshadowing of the Fracture to come.

**Aftermath:**  
- Students whisper both awe and ridicule.  
- DeMarco burns with suppressed fury.  
- This humiliation leads him to the dangerous experimentation that causes the Quantum Fracture.
