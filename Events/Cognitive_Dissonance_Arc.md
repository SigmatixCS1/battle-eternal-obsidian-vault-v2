# The Cognitive Dissonance Arc

The **Cognitive Dissonance Arc** is the first major storyline inside **Saint Radian Academy** in *Battle Eternal v2*.  
Petty gossip, narrative manipulation by the **Furies**, archetypal dream‑manifestations, and occult dread collide as the “Shipping Wars” evolve into chaos.  
The Arc tests the Quartet and their allies, and sets in motion the inevitability of Nemesis within **Castor Nightfall**.

## Act I — The Spark

**Shipping Wars Begin**  
- [[Crystalis]] strategically maintains her popular “ship” with [[DeMarco Zavarus]], leveraging her Illustra persona.

- [[Professor Nyx Helverd]] receives the official F-Link Symposium notice.  
- Sigil appears to him as parasitic.  
- Ignores academy’s warnings, pivots his syllabus to hidden Jungian lessons: *Projection, Shadow, Addiction to Unconsciousness*.  
- Veils truths behind psychological lectures, desperate to seed resistance.  
- Each time he looks at [[Castor Nightfall]], dread overwhelms him — faculty intuition sensing Nemesis.

## Act III — Castor’s Harbinger

**Investigation**  
- [[Spencer Kordell]] & [[Alexander Holmes Harukaza]] investigate the vanishing Centaur.  
- Track leads to Selene → confesses her **recurring dreams always feature Castor.**  
- She whispers: *“He terrifies me.”*  

**Alex Confronts Castor**  
- Alex reaches out, offering a tarot reading.  
- Castor admits: his **crystal ball bleeds heat, black sigils, and symbols he doesn’t recognize.**  
- Alex lays out tarot → catastrophic failure:  
  - Cards explode, evaporate, disintegrate.  
  - One remains: a **black card with a silver sickle**.  
- Spencer logs the event; Castor distant, unnerved.  

**The Psychic Blast**  
- That night, Castor suffers a psychic shockwave, collapses into unconsciousness.

- Near confrontation escalates between the two.  

**Device Debate**  
- Spencer + Grant plan a **beast‑signature detector**.

## Key Themes

- **Logos vs. Division:** Alex & Spencer combine intuition + data amidst noise.  
- **Athena vs. Nemesis:** Crystalis’s strategy collides with Castor’s inevitability.  
- **Empathy vs. Control:** Elara tries to heal, DeMarco commodifies, Elias enforces.  
- **Trivial vs. Cosmic:** Shipping wars as deliberate distraction against rising archetypal doom.  
- **Foreshadowing Judgment:** Castor’s mantle of Nemesis flickers; glimpses haunt Selene, Nyx, Alex.
