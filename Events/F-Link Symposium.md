# F-Link Symposium

*(Existing description remains. This is new content to integrate.)*

## Prelude: Professor Helverd’s Awakening
- Weeks before the event, faculty receive a Symposium announcement email.  
- Attached F-Link logo manifests to [[Professor Nyx Helverd]] as a **living sigil**, parasitic and invasive.  
- This convinces him the Symposium is the **point of no return** for the Academy’s free will.  
- Helverd abandons his normal curriculum and begins an intellectual rebellion in class.  

## The Stakes
- After the Symposium, [[F-Link]] will achieve near-total integration into Saint Radian’s student body.  
- Consciousness engineering will shift from formative to permanent.  
- Professors like Helverd who resist will effectively be silenced.

**Opening:**  
The entire academy gathers under grand banners, glowing with Cabal sigils. Faculty feign enthusiasm; students murmur nervously.

**Key Scenes:**  
1. Professor Helverd receives the F-Link logo as a **living sigil** in his psyche weeks prior, realizing the threat.  
2. Symposium reveals F-Link’s invasive potential as an “augment to consciousness.”  
3. Cabal representatives pitch its inevitability as patriotic and moral duty.

**Climax:**  
Their declaration: “With F-Link, choice becomes unity.” Faculty are pressured into compliance.

**Aftermath:**  
- Resistance quietly coalesces under Helverd.  
- Cabal effectively gains a Trojan horse inside every student’s mind.

# Narrative Description (Story Notes)

**Prelude:**  
Faculty and students receive visitation dreams + official Cabal email invites. The F-Link logo flickers on every surface.  

**Professor Helverd:**  
- Experiences the F-Link logo as a **living sigil** latching parasitically onto his psyche.  
- This revelation cements him as a resistance figure, determined to awaken his students.  

**Event Stakes:**  
- The Symposium is staged in Saint Radian’s Grand Assembly Hall.  
- Cabal officials present F-Link as the “pinnacle of occult technology,” merging human narrative energy with the Dark Hold.  
- Professors are coerced into compliance.  

**Tension:**  
Helverd uses coded lectures in the days leading up to it (Jungian archetypes, addiction, shadow work) to inoculate students. He knows this is the **point of no return**.  

**Aftermath:**  
- Once adopted, F-Link will ensure total Cabal control of the student body.  
- The resistance must act urgently, or their free will is lost permanently.
