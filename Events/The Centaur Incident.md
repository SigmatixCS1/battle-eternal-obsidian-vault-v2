# Narrative Description (Story Notes)

**Opening Scene:**  
Midday courtyard. Students gossiping about the Shipping Wars. A shimmer in the air → tearing hooves, centaurs bursting through.  

**Atmosphere:**  
Confusion and terror. Faculty stall with platitudes like *“part of simulation training”*, but their fear gives them away.  

**Quartet Response:**  
- **Alexander:** panic, tarot sparks to life. Phoenix shadow ignites briefly.  
- **DeMarco:** attempts glyph-wall defense → shattered by a centaur charge.  
- **Crystalis:** coldly efficient, calculating escape routes. Eyelid twitch betrays stress, Griffon silhouette flickers.  
- **Castor:** unnerving calm. Opens psychic "lens," suppresses one centaur mid-charge. Manticore aura snarls.  

**Supporting Cast:**  
- **Spencer**: desperately documenting with notes and sketches → raw material for his blog *The Pattern*.  
- **Grant**: pulls students behind an improvised barricade (fallen bench reinforced with glowing inscriptions).  
- **Quentin**: finally steps in publicly. A single ki strike obliterates a centaur, leaving silence and fear.  

**Aftermath:**  
Whispers take over the campus. Division Engine tries narrative spin (“just a Cabal-approved drill”), but video evidence leaks on student networks → deep cracks in indoctrination begin forming.  

**Foreshadow:**  
On the rooftop, **Yatagarasu** — black divine crow — silently observes, waiting to deliver prophecy.
