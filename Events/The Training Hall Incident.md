# Quentin Arclet: The Training Hall Incident

## Overview
This mini-event centers on a mystery-shrouded showcase of Quentin’s terrifying martial ability. Unlike large story arcs, this “arclet” represents **an isolated, rumor-driven subplot** that rapidly spreads through the student body, cementing Quentin’s reputation as one of Saint Radian’s most unknowable and dangerous students.

## Key Scene
**The Shattered Training Hall**
- During an evening martial arts sparring session in the Saint Radian training hall, Quentin is challenged by a group of advanced physical combat students (possibly Cabal-aligned braggarts seeking to prove dominance).
- What begins as a test escalates instantly: Quentin channels his ki visibly, releasing shockwaves and leaving the wooden dummies and practice floor heavily scarred by sheer pressure waves of energy.
- Witnesses report seeing what looked like “chi fireballs” leaving scorch marks along the walls.  
- The fight ends with Quentin standing silently while his challengers collapse one by one, battered but alive.

## Reactions
- **Student Body:** Rumors explode across campus, retelling and exaggerating what happened. Some insist Quentin vaporized a sparring dummy. Others whisper he was simply holding back, terrifying them further.
- **Professors:** Faculty treat the event like a taboo, refusing to “officially acknowledge” that it even occurred. Professors quietly agree *not to provoke Quentin* — indicating even the Cabal’s trainers fear he operates outside their intended system.  
- **Spencer Kordell:** Treats the incident like a case file. Begins obsessively drawing charts to connect Quentin’s strange ki feats to F-Link research, suspecting biological overlap.  
- **Grant Sterling:** Analyzes the broken tiles and scorch marks with an engineer’s curiosity, quietly admiring Quentin’s control — sees physical proof of energy manipulation that could have technological applications.  
- **DeMarco:** Fumes silently; Quentin is a rival presence who commands fear without Cabal narrative authority.  
- **Castor Nightfall:** The only student Quentin briefly acknowledges as an equal; a silent stare exchanged between them unsettles those watching.

## Narrative Purpose
- Establishes Quentin as an **outlier**, someone **too powerful or mysterious for the Cabal to neatly box** into their Division Engine.  
- Foreshadows Quentin’s dual role later: could become an uncontrollable weapon for the Cabal OR a terrifying anomaly resisting them.  
- Reinforces the theme of **myth making** at Saint Radian — how rumors and fear shape narrative, whether or not facts are clear.
