# Narrative Description (Story Notes)

**Opening:**  
Thousands across the globe tune into a lavish live-broadcasted “performance ritual.” Officially: an avant-garde art event. Subtext: occult outrage-farming.  

**Scene:**  
- Procession of masked Cabal Priests chant narrative glyphs into the Dark Hold.  
- Manufactured scandal plays out in staged violence, designed to spark collective online rage.  
- Outrage reactions immediately spike on Earthly networks → feeding fourth dimension warfare.  

**Impact:**  
- The event is the **first mass public ritual** that openly harvests collective shadow energy.  
- Students at Saint Radian are forced to watch the broadcast, taught to analyze "successful outrage metrics."  
- Spencer logs detailed screenshots, later noticing **subliminal archetypal coding** in the ceremony patterns.  

**Aftermath:**  
The Black Swan Event is effectively **the spark that ignites Fourth Dimension Warfare.** Nothing will remain hidden; from this point, reality itself begins to fracture.
