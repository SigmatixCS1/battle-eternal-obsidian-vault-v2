# Narrative Description (Story Notes)

**Opening:**  
Marketed worldwide as a controversial art performance, the broadcast reaches millions simultaneously.

**Key Scenes:**  
1. Masked Cabal priests chant glyph-coded verses.  
2. Staged acts of sacrilege and violence spark immediate online outrage.  
3. Patterns of subliminal archetypal sigils pulse subliminally through video editing.

**Climax:**  
Hashtags, memes, and outrage spiral online within minutes — turning the ritual into fuel for the Cabal.

**Aftermath:**  
- Students at Saint Radian are required to analyze it as a “case study in outrage metrics.”  
- Spencer quietly documents it for “The Pattern,” realizing the Cabal’s ability to hack collective consciousness.

# Narrative Description (Story Notes)

**Trigger:**  
DeMarco, reeling from the Aegis humiliation, seeks forbidden glory inside restricted academy libraries.  

**Scene:**  
- He taps into “Source” magic: raw unfiltered occult code not meant to be harnessed by humans.  
- The experiment spirals — introducing feedback between 3D physical systems and 4D archetypal myth.  

**Climax:**  
A tiny unseen rupture slices into consensus reality. **The Quantum Fracture**. The skies howl with unseen archetypes pressing against the veil.  

**DeMarco’s Conflict:**  
- Publicly, he hides his involvement.  
- Internally, he feels both the intoxication of touching primordial power AND a devastating fear.  

**Aftermath:**  
- Subtle dimensional bleeding begins → visuals of impossible glyphs “burned” into academy stone walls.  
- Mythical beings begin flickering at night.  
- This single act *sets in motion the Centaur Incident*, the visible escalation of beast incursions.
