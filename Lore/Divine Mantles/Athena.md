# The Mantle of Athena

## üèõÔ∏è Divine Archetype & Domain
Athena is the Olympian goddess of wisdom, tactical warfare, and heroic endeavor. She represents victory achieved not through brute force, but through superior intellect and flawless strategy. Her wisdom is not passive; it is a sharp, active weapon used to deconstruct problems, command respect, and ensure victory before a battle even begins. In a war of narratives, Athena is the ultimate patron of the master strategist.

## üîó Connection to the Avatar
Crystalis's journey is a modern incarnation of Athena's "Trojan Horse" nature‚Äîwisdom hidden within an underestimated vessel. Her former persona, "Illustra," was a shallow form of social strategy, using wit and sarcasm for personal status. Upon awakening her Logos, this raw cunning was transmuted into true tactical genius. Her weaponized sarcasm now serves to dismantle the logical fallacies in the Order's propaganda with surgical precision. She embodies Athena's principle that true authority stems from unshakeable clarity and a plan that accounts for every variable.

## üî• Manifestation in Battle Eternal
The Mantle of Athena empowers Crystalis's Logos in the following ways:
- **Familiar:** The [[Griffon]], a fusion of the king of beasts and the king of birds, is the living symbol of divine authority over multiple domains. Its eagle-like sight represents the strategic omniscience Athena grants‚Äîthe ability to see the entire battlefield from above and identify the enemy's critical weakness.
- **Ascendant Form:** As Crystalis fully embraces her mantle, she will develop the ability to perceive the entire "narrative battlefield." She will act as the Resistance's de facto commander, directing her allies with an **Aura of Tactical Clarity** that allows them to act as a single, perfectly coordinated unit, exploiting openings and executing complex strategies as if they were all extensions of her own will.
