# The Mantle of Helios

**Divine Entity:** Helios
**Domain:** Absolute Truth, Illumination, Authenticity
**Avatar:** [[Alexander Holmes Harukaza]]

---

## üèõÔ∏è Divine Archetype & Domain
Helios is the Titan god of the Sun, a being whose all-seeing eye witnesses everything that happens between the heavens and the earth. He represents the unwavering, clarifying power of light that dispels all shadows, lies, and illusions. His domain is not one of aggressive fire, but of the persistent, life-giving radiance that reveals reality for what it is.

## üîó Connection to the Avatar
Alexander's core identity is a perfect reflection of Helios's nature. His rebellion against the Order of the Black Cross is not born from a desire for destruction, but from an innate inability to tolerate falsehood. He is authentic to a fault. His very presence acts as a clarifying force, causing the complex social manipulations and propaganda of Saint Radian to feel hollow and absurd. He doesn't just fight lies; he passively invalidates them by simply *being*.

## üî• Manifestation in Battle Eternal
The Mantle of Helios manifests through Alexander's Logos in several ways:
- **Familiar:** The [[Phoenix]] is a direct fragment of Helios's essence‚Äîa creature of pure solar fire, truth, and eternal rebirth. It cannot be corrupted or destroyed, just as the sun rises every day.
- **Ascendant Form:** As Alexander grows into his power, he will be able to project an **Aura of Truth**. This is not an attack, but a passive field of illumination that automatically dismantles low-level propaganda, shields allies from mental manipulation, and forces those who rely on deception to confront their own inner reality.
